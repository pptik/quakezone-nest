  The maximum water height above sea level in meters. See image and text below

  - Type 2: Tide Gauge - half of the maximum height (minus the normal tide)of a
  tsunami wave recorded at the coast by a tide gauge. Also called the amplitude.
  - Type 3: Deep Ocean Gauge - half of the maximum height (minus the normal
  tide) of a tsunami wave recorded in the open ocean by a seafloor bottom
  pressure recording system.
  - Type 4: Water height (Post-tsunami survey measurement) - the maximum elevation the wave.

  elevation the wave reaches at the maximum inundation.

  - Type 9: Splash mark (Post-tsunami survey measurement)
  - Type 6: Atmospheric Wave - Tsunami-like phenomena generated by
  meteorological or atmospheric disturbances. These waves can be produced by
  atmospheric gravity waves, pressure jumps, frontal passages, squalls, gales,
  typhoons, hurricanes and other atmospheric sources. Meteotsunamis have the
  same temporal and spatial scales as tsunami waves and can similarly devastate
  coastal areas, especially in bays and inlets with strong amplification and
  well-defined resonant properties. Sometimes referred to as rissaga. The water
  height definition for an atmospheric wave depends on whether it was measured
  by a tide gauge (2), eyewitness (1), or field survey (4,5).
  - Type 7: Seiche - A standing wave oscillating in a partially or fully
  enclosed body of water. It may be initiated by long period seismic waves (an
  earthquake), wind and water waves, or a tsunami. The water height definition
  for a seiche depends on whether it was measured by a tide gauge (2),
  eyewitness (1), or field survey (4,5).

  A number of terms are used to describe the overland flow of the tsunami
  (Figure V.3). It is essential to use the appropriate term for the types of
  measurements used. Important quantities include the tsunami flow depth (code
  10), tsunami height (code 4), the runup height (code 5) and the inundation
  distance. Runup is the maximum ground elevation wetted by the tsunami on a
  sloping shoreline. In the simplest case, the runup value is recorded at the
  maximum inundation distance - the horizontal distance flooded by the wave.
  Flow depth is the depth of the tsunami flood over the local terrain height
  while the tsunami height is the total elevation of the water free surface
  above a reference datum. In some cases where the ground topography is flat,
  large tsunamis can penetrate for hundreds of metres, and several kilometres
  inland. In such cases it may not be practical to quantitatively measure
  inundation distances to the furthest inland extent. In such cases, it is most
  useful to estimate the tsunami height and flow depths close to the shoreline

  When a dollar amount for damage was found in the literature, it was listed in
  the Damage column in millions of U.S. dollars. The dollar value listed is the
  value at the time of the event. To convert the damage to current dollar
  values, please use the [Consumer Price Index Calculator](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/DescribeField.jsp?dataset=101650&search_look=77&field_name=tsevent_vsqp.DAMAGE_MILLIONS_DOLLARS).
  Monetary conversion tables for the time of the event were used to convert
  foreign currency to U.S. dollars.

  For those events not offering a monetary evaluation of damage, the following
  five-level scale was used to classify damage (1990 dollars) and was listed in
  the Damage Description column. If the **actual dollar amount of damage was
  listed**, a descriptor was also added for search purposes.
  
  - 0 = NONE
  - 1 = LIMITED (roughly corresponding to less than $1 million)

  - 4 = EXTREME (~$25 million or more)
  
  When possible, a rough estimate was made of the dollar amount of damage based
  upon the description provided, in order to choose the damage category. In many
  cases, only a single descriptive term was available. These terms were
  converted to the damage categories based upon the authors apparent use of the
  term elsewhere. In the absence of other information, LIMITED is considered
  synonymous with slight, minor, and light, SEVERE as synonymous with major,
  extensive, and heavy, and EXTREME as synonymous with catastrophic.
